Some of the features include extended Markdown based rich editing support, auto-save state so you can close the app anytime, and next time everything will still be there. You can export your notes in PDF, Markdown, and JSON as well, tabs to support opening many notes at the same time and a spell checker.
And the best part? The app is just `1.3 MB` Surprised? with its Rust core, it's blazing fast, secure, and memory-efficient — because we are not giving you a Chromium browser under the hood.

This is just version `0.1`, built in just 3 days, and it already feels complete. Imagine what's coming in the stable `1.0` release — there's a lot more to look forward to! Stay tuned for the open-source release.
